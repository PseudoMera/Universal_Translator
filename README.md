# Universal_Translator
Universal translator is a console application that allows you to convert any length unit under the metric system to another in the same system. Universal translator will requiere you to feed it a file (the format of this file is discribed below) with the units you want to convert.

Universal translator uses the same base unit as the metric system, which is the meter.

## File_Format
You can find an example file in the following link describing how your file should be structured and an example file showing you how the result file will look after the conversion. The file should have a .txt extension.
